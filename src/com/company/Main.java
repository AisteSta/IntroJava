	// What is Java?
        //Java is an object-oriented programming language that allows us to model
        //real life functionality as objects in our code.

        //Features of Java
        //Java is a strictly-typed language
        //Java is also a compiled language, it is turned into bytecode
        //Java is a high-level language.
        //Java is run on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
        //Java JVM creates platform-independence for Java.

        //What is programming?
        //Computer programming is a process of giving a computer or IT device a series of instructions
        //that tell it the order and process in which to carry out or execute a specific task or set of
        // types.

        //Concepts of programming in Java.
        //variables and data types
        //conditionals
        //loops
        //methods
        //classes

        //Variables and Datatypes
        // primitive values
        // char
        // int (Integer)
        //short
        //byte
        //long
        //float // has a max of 7
        //double

        //Complex Objects
        //Strings

        //Variable: Think of a variable like an empty box, where as soon as you create the box,
        //you decide what type of items you can put in the box and you cannot put a different type
        // of item later on.

        // P.s. You cannot have a variable with the same name in the same scope in Java.

        // A variable declaration is simply giving your variable a name and a data type.
        //A variable initialization is the point where you finally give that variable a value to start with.


        //int number; //variable declaration
        //number = 4; //variable initialization

        //int value = 6; // variable declaration and initialization in one line.
        //byte byteValue = 1;

        //char charValue = '9';
        //String text = "I am going to school";

       //long digits = 5L;
        //float decimalFloat = 3.683f;
        //double decimalDouble = 5.2323235353;

          // Shortcut to comment a line of code: CTRL + /

        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }

    // Arithmetic Operators include:
    //+- Addition
    //-- Subtraction
    // / Division
    // *-Multiplication
    // % - Modulus (It divides the values and returns the remainder) e.g 2 % 2-> 0
